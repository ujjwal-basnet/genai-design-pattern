### we can controll output by prompt like , output in json , output like this or that

## but insted we use grammer because 
- only larger model are better at instruction following so if you want to use low cost model these prompts might not do well 

- llm version change , different llm output diff thus one prompt mightt works for one but not for another the same way

- A better approach is to represent the rules you want in a generalizable way,
which is called a grammar
